# serverless-kube-watch-trigger
A lightweight Kubernetes operator that turns **Kubernetes API server watch events into trigger sources** for serverless functions and external systems. It allows you to declaratively define *when* and *how* functions or webhooks should fire in response to changes in Kubernetes resources ‚Äî without modifying the API server or deploying heavy eventing frameworks.

## Description
`Serverless-kube-watch-trigger` bridges the gap between **Kubernetes-native resource events** and **serverless workloads**.  
At its core, it watches selected Kubernetes resources (built-in or CRDs) using efficient watch streams, and then dispatches structured trigger events based on user-defined specifications. These triggers can launch serverless functions (e.g. OpenFaaS, Knative), send webhooks, or integrate with external systems such as CI/CD pipelines or monitoring tools.

## Installation

Please follow the guide in the [release](https://github.com/HariKube/serverless-kube-watch-trigger/releases) section.

## Getting Started

### üìå Overview

An `HTTPTrigger` watches a target Kubernetes resource (e.g., `Deployment` or any other Custom Resources), filters events, and sends HTTP requests when matching events happen.

Each trigger consists of:

* **Resource selector** (what to watch)
* **Event filters** (when to trigger)
* **Endpoint configuration** (where to send)
* **Auth / Headers / Body** configuration (what to send)
* **Delivery policies** (how to deliver)

### üñç Spec Details

#### üéØ **Resource Selection**

| Field               | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resource`          | Target resource kind + API version to watch.                                           |
| `namespaces`        | List of namespaces to watch.                                                           |
| `labelSelectors`    | Optional label selectors to filter resources.                                          |
| `fieldSelectors`    | Optional field selectors to filter resources.                                          |
| `eventTypes`        | Which events to trigger on (`ADDED`, `MODIFIED`, `DELETED`).                           |
| `eventFilter`       | Go template expression evaluated on objects. Return true to trigger. |
| `concurrency`       | Max parallel triggers.                                                                 |
| `sendInitialEvents` | Whether to emit initial events for existing objects.                                   |

---

#### üåê **Endpoint**

One of:

* `url.static` ‚Äì fixed URL
* `url.template` ‚Äì URL template with Go template syntax
* `url.service` ‚Äì service name + optional URI strategy (static/template)

`method` defines the HTTP verb (default: `POST`).

---

#### üîê **Authentication**

Under `auth`, you may configure one or more of:

* `basicAuth`:
  Uses username and password from a secret key reference.

* `tls`:
  mTLS configuration with CA, client cert, and key references.

---

#### üì® **Headers**

Headers can be defined in three ways:

* `static`: fixed key/value pairs
* `template`: dynamic values using Go templates
* `fromSecretRef`: load header values from Kubernetes secrets

---

#### üß∞ **Body**

Controls the request payload.

| Field         | Description                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contentType` | Content type of the body (default: `application/json`).                                 |
| `template`    | Go template to generate the request body. `{{ toJson . }}` dumps the full event object. |
| `signature`   | Optional HMAC or static signature added to a header.                                    |

---

#### üöö **Delivery**

| Field     | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `timeout` | Maximum request duration (default: `10s`). |
| `retries` | Number of retry attempts on failure.    |

---

### ‚ö° Usage Tips

* Use `{{ toJson . }}` to include the **entire event** as JSON in the body.
* Combine `eventFilter` with label/field selectors for fine-grained control.
* TLS and BasicAuth can be used together if the target requires both mutual TLS and credentials.
* Upon any error, the operator first updates the trigger's status field. It then tries to restart the watcher, resuming from the status.lastResourceVersion.

---

### üöÄ Apply the Trigger

```bash
kubectl apply -f full-httptrigger-example.yaml
```

Then modify or create a matching `Deployment` ‚Äî the webhook endpoint will receive JSON payloads for every matching event.

---

### üß™ Debugging

* Use `kubectl describe httptrigger <name>` to see status and events.
* Check logs of the controller that processes `HTTPTrigger` resources.
* Use `toPrettyJson` in templates to make payloads human-readable during testing.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/serverless-kube-watch-trigger:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don‚Äôt work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/serverless-kube-watch-trigger:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/serverless-kube-watch-trigger:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/serverless-kube-watch-trigger/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
